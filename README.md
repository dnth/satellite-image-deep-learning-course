# course
- Course website using [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/books/)
- Goal: create MVP course ASAP by keeping contributing simple and enabling reuse of existing material as much as possible
- Each chapter is a markdown file that can contain links to videos, presentations and notebooks. 
- Note the `.qmd` file format is Quarto flavour of markdown.
- Notebooks should be self contained by including a cell for installing requirements, and runnable on Google colab

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Each chapter has an Issue on this repository, feel free to comment on these issues and if you decided to work on a chapter, assign the relevant issue to yourself. Then create a fork of this repository with your changes and make a pull request. Note that notebooks must be runnable in the Google Colab environment. Useful links below:
