# course
- Course website using [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/books/)
- Goal: create MVP course ASAP by keeping contributing simple and enabling reuse of existing material as much as possible
- Each chapter is a markdown file that can contain links to videos, presentations and notebooks
- Notebooks should be self contained by including a cell for installing requirements, and runnable on Google colab

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Create a fork with your changes and make a pull request. Note that notebooks must be runnable in the Google Colab environment.

## Using Quarto
- Either use the CLI or the tools in VSCode
- To preview the website in the browser: `quarto preview`
