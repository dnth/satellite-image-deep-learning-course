# course
- Course website using [quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/books/)
- Goal: create MVP course ASAP by keeping contributing simple and enabling reuse of existing material as much as possible
- Each chapter is a markdown file that can contain links to videos, presentations and notebooks. 
- Note the `.qmd` file format is Quarto flavour of markdown. 
- Notebooks should be self contained by including a cell for installing requirements, and runnable on Google colab

## Contributing
